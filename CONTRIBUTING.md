# How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from anyone looking to create simple Python examples for beginners! 

Fork, then clone the repo at:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/Open-Source-Hello-World.git
```

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python installed. This repository focuses on examples of Python 2.7.x code. To install Python, follow [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/installation/).

## Making Changes
Create a branch to base your work on, and make changes to your branch. Before merging your branch back into the master branch of your fork, pull updates from this source origin. Once you verify that your updates merged successfully on your master branch and all errors are resolved, open a pull request to merge changes to the origin.

## Possible Contributions
We welcome contributions of any form. At present, the most needed are:
+ Adding examples for simple Python code (e.g. "Hello, World!", I/O reading/printing, data structures, etc.)
+ Creating documentation to help users navigate basic Python and learn how to run the example code on their own machines
